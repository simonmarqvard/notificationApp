  Invasive notifications from the web

<p>
  Notify is an application built in Electron.js using JavaScript, Sockets.io,
  Node.js and Shell.js. When the application is running on your computer an
  online page displays it for everyone else to see. Green means your computer
  and application is turned on and red means it is not. From an online page any
  user can send notifications, activate the screensaver or turn off a computer
  entirely. This is managed by accessing native software through Electron and
  sending shell scripts with Shell.js.

  This project was part of an exploration, investigating the question: "Would
  more creative applications in software be unleashed if we didn't start by
  saddling designers and developers with privacy and security concerns?" I
  wanted to explore what we could do with software if instead of always thinking
  safety first, we put interaction first and safety last. The intention was to
  break from the restrictions and limitations that comes with safe and private
  applications.
  The sourcecode for the Electron application and webpage making up the project is split into separate folders.
