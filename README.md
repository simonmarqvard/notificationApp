<p>
  Notify is an application built in Electron.js using JavaScript, Sockets.io,
  Node.js and Shell.js. When the application is running on your computer an
  online page displays it for everyone else to see. Green means your computer
  and application is turned on and red means it is not. From an online page any
  user can send notifications, activate the screensaver or turn off a computer
  entirely. This is managed by accessing native software through Electron and
  sending shell scripts with Shell.js.
